Game Server
===========
A university module which required us to develop a TCP and UDP game server in Erlang. This was our first interaction with a functional language which was incredibly mind-bending at the time. The server I developed was tested on Windows and Linux but should theoretically work on any platform that Erlang is supported on. In terms of grade I got 80% of the marks available for the server but unfortunately only achieved 53% in total. The reason for the low grade was because we needed to make a C++ client which integrated with the server to allow for networked multiplayer, I ran out of time and didn't manage to implement a client. On reflection I needed better time management and learned an incredible amount about different programming paradigms but I'm happy with the resulting server.

A Windows/Linux-tested build is available here: https://github.com/storm20200/UniversitySecondYearGameServer/releases/latest
