Game Server
===========
A university module which required us to develop a TCP and UDP game server in Erlang. This was our first interaction with a functional language which was incredibly mind-bending at the time. The server I developed was tested on Windows and Linux but should theoretically work on any platform that Erlang is supported on.

A Windows/Linux-tested build is available here: https://github.com/storm20200/UniversitySecondYearGameServer/releases/latest
